# 6140-Capstone-Project

The data used in this project is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing 
campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if 
the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. The data was donated to the UCI Machine Learning
Repository on 02/14/2012. 

The goal of this project is to predict of a client would subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit. We will be using the Logistic 
Regression and Random Forest Classifier to build prediction models to address the question raised.
